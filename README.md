Literate programming menggunakan Jupyter Notebook: SNIPS2018
---

This repo stores the main manuscript and supoprting materials for the [SNIPS 2018](https://fmipa.itb.ac.id/event/seminar-nasional-inovasi-dan-pembelajaran-sains-snips-2018/). The article was about using literate programming to teach code related courses. We could embed data, code, outputs with the technical description into one file in PDF or HTML format using Jupyter Notebook. Students are only required to copy the `*.pynb` file and run it with their own computers to get the same results as the teacher has demonstrated. Another example of this technique is R Markdown.
